#It looks like the error is due to an illegal move being passed to the `san()` function, which expects only legal or null moves to be passed to it. This can happen when the PGN is being written in the output file.

#The issue could be caused by not updating the board position when iterating over the common moves. You should update the board position in the for loop when adding a variation (move).

#Here's the modified version of your code with the suggested change implemented:
